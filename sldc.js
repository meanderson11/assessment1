// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing and Intergration
Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis of Requirements = "This is the Second step, is in which the goal is to plan what the application is supposed to do and the requirements in needs to run that application. "
const Design = "This is the Third step, it models the way the software and systems application may work."
const Implementation = "This is the fouth step, in which the developer begins to execute and build the code according to the requirements and the designs discribed in the design process section. "
const Testing and Intergration = "This is the fifth step, in which the developer can begin to test the system against the requirements. this process also  includes the intergration into the current software enviroment. "
const Maintain = "This is the final step, in which the software has been fully tested and no high prioraty issues remain in the software and it can now be used by the consumer, there will be a maintance team that make sure any issues that arise they could resolve it with a quick hot key or too small they just wait till the next software update rollout."
